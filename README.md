# «C'MON VSCO!»



It's what I say when I try to *copy-paste* the link of an image from the photo-sharing platform [VSCO](http://vsco.co/) and realize it does not allow to *right-click*.  

No matter you want to embed your own photo from VSCO to your blog, or found a nice piece of artwork you would like to set as wallpaper, **C'MON VSCO** will help you to not dive into HTML source code!  

It needs the URL of the page the image is displayed. For example, you can try with this one :

```

```
